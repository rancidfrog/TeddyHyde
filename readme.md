Learn more at teddyhyde.com

Teddy Hyde is an Android application. To hack on it, just fork this project, and then build it using eclipse, intellij or ant. I hope gradle support is coming soon.

When you have something to add to the project, send a pull request.

### Prerequisites

1. Read the last chapter of Pro Git. And, read all the other chapters as well, but don't skip the last one.
2. Android development. There are lots of good references out there.
3. Learn about writing tests for Android. Make sure any pull requests have test cases.
